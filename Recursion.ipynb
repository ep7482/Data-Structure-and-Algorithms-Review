    "## Recursion\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions of smaller instances of the same problem.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "All recursive functions have 2 parts:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>A base case (or cases) defined, which defines when the recursion is stopped - otherwise it will go on forever</li>\n",
    "    <li>Breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and invoking the recursive call</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Most common examples of recursion is the Fibonnacci sequence.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Base cases: fib(0) = 0 and fib(1) = 1</li>\n",
    "    <li>Recurrence relation: fib(i) = fib(i - 1) + fib(i - 2)</li>\n",

    "Algorithms that use recursion = binary search, merge sort, tree traversal, depth-first search, etc.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Recursion is the process of defining a problem (or the solution to a problem) in terms of (a simpler version of) itself.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Tail recursion is when the very last statement is calling the recursive algorithm. Tail recursion can be directly translated into loops.\n",

    "Parts of a recursive algorithm:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Base case (when to stop)</li>\n",
    "    <li>Work towards base case</li>\n",
    "    <li>Recrusive call (call ourselves)</li>\n",

    "### Things to look out for\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>Always define a base case</li>\n",
    "    <li>Recursion is useful for permutations because it generates all combinations and tree-based questions. You should know how to generate all permutations of a sequence, as well as how to handle duplicates.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Recursion implicitly uses a stack. Hence all recursive approaches can be rewritten iteratively using a stack. Beware of cases where the recursion level goes too deep and causes stackoverflow. Recursion will never be space complexity O(1), unless there is tail-call optimization (TCO).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Number of base cases</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Corner Cases\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>n = 0</li>\n",
    "    <li>n = 1</li>\n",
    "    <li>Make sureyou have enough base cases to cover all possible invocation of the recursive function.</li>\n",

    "\n",
    "### Techniques\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization- you may be computing the result from previously computed inputs. Memoization can greatly improve the efficiency of the algorithm and the time complexity becomes `O(n)`."
