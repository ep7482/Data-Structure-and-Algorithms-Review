    "## Linked List\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "Like arrays, a linked list is used to represent sequential data. It is a linear collection of data element, whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory as opposed to arrays, where data is stored in sequential blocks of memory. Instead, each element contains an address of the next element. It is a data strucutre consisting of a collection of nodes which together represents a sequence. Each node contains: data, reference to the next node in the sequence. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "<ins>Advantages</ins> - Insertion and deletion of a node in a list (given its location) is O(1), whereas in arrays the following elements must be shifted\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ins>Disadvantages</ins> - Access time is linear, you have to traverse from the start, O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of linked list\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "<ins>Singly linked list</ins> - A linked list where each node points to the next node and the last node points to null.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ins>Doubly linked list</ins> - A linked where each node has 2 pointers, <i>next</i> which points to the next node, <i> prev</i> which points to the previous node. The <i>prev</i> pointer of the first node and the <i>next</i> pointer of the last node points to null.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<ins>Circular linked list</ins> - A singly linked list where the last node points back to the first node. There is a circular double linked list variant where the <i>prev</i> pointer of the first node points to the last node and the <i>next</i> pointer of the last node points to the first node.\n",

    "### Techniques\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sentinel/dummy nodes\n",
    "Adding a dummy node at the head and/or tail might help handle edge cases where operations have to be preformed at the head or tail. The presence of a dummy nodes essentially ensures that operations will never have to be done on the head or tails thereby removing the headache of writing conditional checks to deal with null pointers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Two Pointers\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><ins>Getting the kth from the last node</ins> - have 2 pointers, where one is k nodes ahead of the other. When the node ahead reaches the end, the other node is k nodes behind.</li>\n",
    "    <li><ins>Detecting cycles</ins> - have 2 pointers, where one pointer increments twice as much as the other, if the 2 points meet, there's a cycle.</li>\n",
    "    <li><ins>Getting the middle node</ins> - have 2 pointers, where one poninter increments twice as fast as the other. When the fast node reaches the end of the list, the slower node will be at the middle. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using Space\n",
    "Many linked-list problems can be easily solved by creating a new linked-list and adding nodes to the new linked list with the final result. However, this takes up more space and makes the question less challenging. Do in-place instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elegant Modification Operations\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "You can modify the <i>next</i> pointer and data of a linked list. Common operations are:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li><ins>Truncate a list</ins> - set the <i>next</i> pointer to null at the last element</li>\n",
    "    <li><ins>Swapping values of nodes</ins> - just swap the value of 2 nodes, no need to swap the next pointer</li>\n",
    "    <li><ins>Combining 2 lists</ins> - attach the head of the second list to the tail of the first list</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
